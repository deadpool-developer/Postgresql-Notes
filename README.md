# Postgresql-Notes
All the commands from scratch.
REDIS RESIDES IN RAM WE STORE DATA WHICH WE NEED FREQUENTLY. IT IS STORED IN CPU. AS IT IS STORED IN MEMORY AND RAM SO WE CANNOT STORE HEAVY DATA IN REDIS BECAUSE IT WILL RESULT IN SLOW FUNCTIONING OF THE SYSTEM.
POSTGRESQL IS STORED IN HARD-DISK. WE CAN STORE PLENTY AMOUNT OF DATA AS IT IS THE DATABASE WHICH IS USED TO STORE THE DATA. THE DATA WHICH DO NOT NEED FREQUENTLY IS STORED IN POSTGRESQL. AS IT IS STORED IN HARD DRIVES, WE ARE NOT CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY OUR DATA WILL CONSUME.
